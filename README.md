# Material CV

This is my personal CV project in Angular (currently draft) but feel free to use it for your needs.


To see a running example visit [aleksander-lech.com](http://aleksander-lech.com).

## Configuration

To change the CV content go to the `/src/assets/content` directory and edit `cv.json` and images in the images subfolder.

## Building

Run `npm install` and then `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--configuration production` flag for a production build.

## Runing the project locally
Run `npm start`

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
