        "summary": "I have graduated from the Gdansk University of Technology Faculty of Technical Physics and Applied Mathematics with Masters of Science, Engineer degree. I have started my professional career long time before the graduation. I used to work as a Java EE Developer as a contractor. During my 10 years’ experience I have been given an opportunity to participate in many interesting projects for various sectors.  I like digging into technology related topics, solving difficult problems as well as supporting other team mates. That’s why I always used to prefer architect roles that gave me possibility to test new technologies as well as develop API’s and frameworks. I am a passionate of functional programming and Android development after work. How can I help you?",
