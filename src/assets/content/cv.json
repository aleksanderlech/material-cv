        "summary": "In 2009 I have graduated from the Gdansk University of Technology at the Faculty of Technical Physics and Applied Mathematics with Masters of Science in Applied Computer Science, Engineer degree. I have started my professional career a long time before graduation though.\n\n During my over 10 years’ journey through the software development world, I have been allowed to participate in many interesting projects for various sectors. \n\nI like digging into technology-related topics, solving challenging problems as well as supporting other teammates. I also have strong foundations in API and framework design as well as DevOps.\nI believe that solid, clean and quality code is a key to success. That way of thinking always used to build enough trust within the organization to reward me with architect or techleading roles.\n\nMy prefered language was always been Java that I also consider as my primary language however I do have a lot of experience with full-stack development and other languages as well.",
